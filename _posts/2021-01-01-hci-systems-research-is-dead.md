Sorry for the clickbait. Let me rephrase: _at least to me_, [Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems research is dead](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1326). In this article, I share my experience doing systems research and rationale for leaving academia for industry.

**What's up with the leaves?** You will notice strong claims in this article, such as the one above, link to a website called Socratrees. I [welcome you to sign up for private beta](https://socratrees.azurewebsites.net/authenticate/register) and engage with my arguments there to show how foolish they are. You can comment on specific claims I make in this blog post, express agreement by clicking the droplet, or even better, provide counter arguments. Socratrees is one example of what I call "systems research" and will play a crucial part in this story.

## What Is Systems Research?

I call systems research the type of research that is published as _systems papers_ in HCI.
It is a specific type of "artifact contribution" in HCI which is different in nature from other artifact contributions such as new input and interaction techniques ([Wobbrock & Kient, 2016][4]).
[UIST recognizes "systems" as a specific type of contribution](https://uist.acm.org/uist2019/author-guide/) and cites [Levin and Redell (1983)][1] and [Olsen (2007)][2] for guidelines to authors and reviewers of such papers.

> It presents a real system, either by a global survey of an entire system or by a selective examination of specific themes embodied in the system. — [Levin & Redell, 1983][1]

Olsen qualifies _user interface systems_ research as researching ...

> [c]omplex systems [that] [generally do not yield to simple controlled experimentation](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1340). This is mostly due to the fact that [good systems deal in complexity](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1343) and [complexity confounds controlled experimentation](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1344). — [Olsen, 2007][2]

Lastly, a Communications of ACM blog post on ["What Makes a Good HCI Systems Paper"][3] by Tessa Lau states:

> Systems often try to solve a novel problem for which there was no previous approach. The value of these systems might not be quantified until they are deployed in the field and evaluated with large numbers of actual users.  Yet doing such evaluation incurs a significant amount of time and engineering work, [particularly compared to non-systems papers](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/985).

## Decline in Systems Research

> In the early days of graphical user interfaces, the creation of new architectures for interactive systems was a lively and healthy area of research. [This has declined in recent years](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1338). — [Olsen, 2007][2]

Olsen lists three reasons for this decline: (1) [stable and widely used platforms such as Windows, Mac, and Linux now dictate the user interface architecture](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1347), (2) [current HCI researchers lack skills in toolkit or windowing system architecture and design](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1349), and (3) [there is a lack of appropriate criteria for evaluating systems architectures](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1355).

This last point specifically, a shortcoming in the review process, is what Olsen hopes to address in his paper. But, not much seems to have changed in the past 13 years, as this remains [a recurring limitation—and frustration—for HCI researchers that do have the necessary skill set to perform systems research and try to get it published](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1357). Here are a select few excerpts in chronological order:

> [The reviewers simply do not value the difficulty of building real systems and how hard controlled studies are to run on real systems for real tasks.](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/970)  —   James Landay (**2009**). [I give up on CHI/UIST](https://dubfuture.blogspot.com/2009/11/i-give-up-on-chiuist.html)

> [[T]hose following a social science tradition ...  are often the most available reviewers for a systems paper on a social computing topic](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1359) ... [and]...  [may reject a paper until it has conclusively proven an effect](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1364) — Bernstein et al. (**2011**). [The trouble with social computing systems research][5]

> [E]ven with specific engineering committees at CHI and whole conferences such as EICS, there is still a lot of confusion about the science part, and [we still have a hard time acknowledging systems research](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1369). ... [T]here is still little agreement among researchers on what makes good systems research. — Michael Nebeling (**2017**). [Playing the Tricky Game of Toolkits Research][7]

>  [R]esearchers experience toolkit papers as being hard to publish due to various biases ... [A]cceptance of toolkits as a research contribution remains a challenge and a topic of much recurrent discussion. — Ledo et al. (**2018**). [Evaluation Strategies for HCI Toolkit Research][6]

## The End of Systems Research

[What once was the heart and soul of a growing new field](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1456), and [gave rise to omnipresent technologies such as the Personal Computer](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1491) and [World Wide Web](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1493), is now the underdog at the party.
Simply put: [systems research is not valued as much as other types of contributions in HCI](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/1451).
As a result, this [gives academic researchers no incentive to do systems research](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/1007); it is a certain way to stall your academic career [as it is much harder to get system papers accepted than other types of contributions](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/1009). And, we all know that [publication count matters in academia](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/1011).

Ska punk may not be for everyone, but I found ["A Moment of Silence" by Streetlight Manifesto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5_tbnaoGiE) a particularly suitable soundtrack to describe how I feel as a systems researcher in the HCI community.

> A moment of silence, please, for those who never get the chance,
> They show up to the party but they’re never asked to dance.
