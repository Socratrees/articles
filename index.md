## What is this?

[**Socratrees**](http://socratrees.wiki) is a [prototype](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04478) discussion platform which allows outlining arguments into hierarchies of supporting and opposing statements.
While there are merits in representing arguments as such, e.g., it enables more focused discussion and opens up arguments to falsification, traditional writing remains an extremely powerful medium.

Therefore, rather than intending to replace traditional writing, Socratrees is designed to _augment_ linear text. This webpage hosts example articles which use the Socratrees web plugin to load statement information from Socratrees linked to in argumentative writing.

### Example: Pineapple Does Not Belong on Pizza

Many people believe [pineapple does not belong on pizza](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/530), yet there is some controversy surrounding this topic.
[Italians don't put pineapple on pizza](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/531) because [it is supposed to be a salty dish](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1071).
[An opinion that carries weight](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/532) knowing that [pizza is of Italian origin](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/897).
Some have spread misinformation that [pizza was invented to use up leftovers from the previous day](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/890), and while [this might sound logical](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/891), it [definitely is not how pizza originated](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/890?inverse=true).
Regardless, [Hawaiian pizza is widely available across the world](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/1074) and, for example, [very popular in Australia](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/790).
In the end, [it is up to the individual to decide what to put on their pizza](http://socratrees.wiki/statement/details/885).
